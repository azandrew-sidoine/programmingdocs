## History

### Waterfall

It's a legacy project management framework in which tasks or steps are handled in a linear fashion, meaning each step is completed before going to the next steps.
In the `waterfall` framework, requirements are defines and completed for each step before moving to the next step.

Cons: - Product is not testable until a functional version of the product is available. - When product fails to provide great user experience, a redesign is required and the overall waterfall process is re-implemented to provide a new updated version which causes time and money cost.

### Agile

In agile we define the project objectives, and iterate over each steps of the `waterfall` model for each feature of the product being implemented.

**Note**
Agile helps in identifying dead feature before implementing them, helping developpers to deliver solutions in time.

**Note**
A good agile teams adjust it processes based on enviromentale / requirements impacts.

- The Agile Manifesto
  - `Individual interaction` vs `Processes/software tools`
    It's better to work/collaborate with people vs software processes
  - `Working software` vs `Comprehensive documentation`
    Prototype (Visual working product) of final product better than product documentation explaining what the software is doing.
  - `Customer collaboration` vs `Contract Negociation`
    Working with application users
  - `Responding to changes` vs `Following plan`
    If engineers discovers what the are doing is wrong, they better stop doing it, instead continuing to go down the raft.

Cons:
Agile assumes people in teams are interchangeable, which they are not in some team on some projects.
Collaboration can create a huge tie up in agile teams if collaborators can understand each other.

## Type of agile system or framework

### Scrum (1990's)

Scrum framework vision is based on 3 main concepts:

- Transparency
  All of decision in a scrum team are transparent.
  Anyone in the team who need to be involved in a decision is informed and involve.
  Anyone in the team that needs to undestand why something was done can.

**Note**
No one in the team should said, no one told me about that. Because it's every one responsibility to know and share information about what is to be build, what is to be worked on, etc...

- Inspection
  Any workd from anyone in the team should be inspected, design, deliverable code. The team think proactively on bug, issues and features implementations.
  If any issue occured while building a feature, the team brainstorm about how the problem is to be solved, and find the solution together.

- Adaptability
  Adapt any process to be build into the reality the are actualy dealing with, and find the structural solution.

**Note**
In scrum the responsibility for project management does not seat with producer, Design lead or Software lead... It's the team responsability guided by their team leads.

**Warning**
The above statement does not mean the scrum team does not hasve constraint, project guide, etc... Scrum teams explain to producer, executives, administratives how much they think they can achieve in a give amount of time.

#### Sprints

It's the way a scrum project divide it design iteration cycle.

- Time constraints

Sprint basically can cover a month, but most teams are using 2 weeks instead. 6 months projects can be divided into 6 minimum sprint or 12 if sprint might take 2 weeks.

- Anatomy of a Sprint

-- Meetings: Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective

- Sprint planning/Sprint backlog
    Taken from project/product backlogs, we plan the sprint with sprint backlog

- Daily Scrum
    During each sprint day, team defines the tasks to be completed in the day

- Sprint Review
    At the end of each sprint day, a review is done about what is to be done and what have been done by the team members

- Retrospective
    Team plan for the next sprint day.

-- Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Tasklist, Scrumboard

- Tasklist
    Because product backlogs consists of broader tasks, scrum team break down each tasks into smaller tasks that must be handled.

#### Project backlogs / Product backlogs

It's an organized prioritirize feature list for a product to be build and is the only source of requirements for any changes to be made in the product.

**Note**
It's maintained prioritized by the `Product Owner`.

- Product backlogs techniques

-- User stories (Testable, User focused)
    It's just a user specific way of defining features. It helps designer, developper, describe the feature to a person (User, Desgner, Developper, Artist) who does not participate in writing the product document, in order for him/help to test the product and confirm that it actualy works.

    The story should be able to describe and tell users the problem it's solving and why it's being implemented.

#### Sprint backlogs

It's the list of features that mights be implemented in each sprint.

### Product Owner

He is the person who holds the solvation of a product. The person who will identified the what are the feature that needs to be implemented and confirmed that the features has been implemented.

### Scrum Master

Runs the meeting, serves as the facilitator and the mediator, and ensure that the scrum is followed and the team is working reasonably and smoothly. They get stuck with update in product backlogs, sprint backlogs, Tasklist, Scrumboard, and whatever record keeping the team needs to have.

**Note**
They are responsible for setting up meeting and making sure it happens.

### Team member

Any individual that participate to the run of a scrum project.

### Scrum board

Scrum board is just a dashboard that keeps tracks of project backlogs, Tasklist, and status of each tasks.

#### Scrum Team Meeting

Scrum team meeting must mee the following requirements:

- Timeboxing
    It's the technique of deciding before a meeting or any specific activity takes place, the amount of time it's going to take. Any time after that is wasted.

Example:
    Sprint are big time box based.

- Clear Agendas
    If you don't know why you are having a meeting, simply don't have the meeting. Identify who should be included on the meeting.

- Involved Participants

##### Sprint review meeting

After each sprint, setup a sprint review meeting to evaluate the product and features of a given sprint

##### Sprint retrospective meeting

During the restrospective meeting the overall process during the sprint is reviewed.
It consist of identifying what went right and what went wrong in order to make the next sprint better. Looks back what has been done in the past and find what will be improved in the future.

##### Daily Scrum

Every day or everytime the team meets. It involves each member of the scrum team. Questions like:

- What each member has done since the last meeting ?
- What is to be done today ?
- What is blocking each or any team member ?

**Note**
The time box for each daily meeting is in averrage 10 min.
