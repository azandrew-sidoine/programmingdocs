## Empathize with Users

### Empathize with users

Q: How to empathize with users ?

A: Here is a list of question that helps being more empathic:

- Ask a lot of questions
  As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.

- Become more observant
In interviews where the user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes.
**Note**
Take detailed note or even record sessions with users.

- Be an active Listener
Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next.

- Request Input
t’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.
**Note**
Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you.

- Be open-minded
We all have biases. Remember, `a bias is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information`.
You should learn to set your biases aside to better empathize with others.

- Keep current on UX research
Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology.

### Recruiting participant

To decide who to recruit UX Designer needs to ask himself some question like:

- What is the goal of the interview needs to be conducted ?
- Who are the potential interviewee for the given interview ?
- What is the appropriate venue for the interview ?
- Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with ?
- etc...

Finding interviewee must be started from:

- Close friends and families
- Then extended to social networks
- or Even professional network like LinkedIn
- or optionally hire a thrird party interview agency to find interviewee for you

### Determine research goals

As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with?

Below are some common research goals when it comes with empathizing with people:

- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.
