# Week 3 : Understand design sprints

## Design Sprint (Created by Google Ventures)

* Definition

It's a time-bound process, with `5 phases` typically spread over `5 full 8-hour days.` . Process of solving critical business problems in 5 days.

Day 1 (Understand): Sharing information between department and creating user's centered journey.
Day 2 (Ideate): Team works independently to generate (sketch) possible solution to the problem
Day 3 (Decide): Merge independant work on (day 2) and decide on the best approach
Day 4 (Prototype): Prototype
Day 5 (Test): Testing phase of the product

**Note**
Before a team begins a design sprint, `theyâ€™ve already identified the design challenge they want to address` . Design sprints help a team answer questions, define product directions, and figure out cross-team strategies.

**Note**
The approach might seems linear, but in practique it comes out to be an iterative approach to solving business critical problem.

* Goal

-- Solve critical design challenge through designing, prototyping and testing ideas with users

* Benefits

-- Save time (Teams cut down several month of decision to a single week)
-- Create a path to product marketing
-- Prioritize user
-- Test Product before launch

* Question that might require design sprint ?

-- Is there many potential solution to the challenge
-- Does the challenge require cross-functional teams
-- Is the challenge wide enough

### Design Sprint Phases

* Understand
Learn from expert and other team members (outside users as well) to learn from the problem.
* Ideate
Coming up with ideas an building sketches independantly
* Decide
Decide on the best design that will fit user needs
* Prototype
Prototype (not a finish product) but a solution for the design challenge
* Testing
Put the prototype in front of users for testing find out if the design challenge is solved.

### Benefits of design Sprints

* It's all about the user
* Every person in a sprint room (Office intern, to senior stake holder, person people with lot)
* Best ideas rise to the top
* Time to focus
* Lower risks from unsuccessful product marketing

## Design sprint planning

### Resume

**Value**
The value of a Design Sprint comes from bringing a cross-functional team together to collaborate in-person.

**Note**
A Design Sprint team should include people who will be responsible for executing the product, process, vision, or strategy after the Sprint.

 `Teams typically include a UX Designer, a User Researcher, a Product Manager, a Developer, and if possible key members of leadership.`

### Research, Existing Data and Lightning Talks

The first question that should be asked when planning a Sprint is what do you know about your users, and do you have enough research to inform the Design Sprint. Collect all of your research in one place. Then, review the existing materials and research for gaps in knowledge about users or the problem area. From there, assess whether or not you need to conduct more research prior to the Design Sprint.

### Basic Ideas

* User research
It's always the first step in any sprint process. You do not need to have a details view of user need... A broad idea might be sufficient.

* Calling experts
It's up to the planner to call in and organize talk with team and/or industry expert, to understand the needs and goals of the research.

* Find the right place
Space or room where the research will be conducted must provide participant equal value to conduct the research

    -- Accomodations for anyone who needs them
    -- Confortable furniture that one can move arround easily
    -- Whiteboards to capturre your ideas and hang sticky notes

* Gather suppliers
Ensure anyone have what they need in order to complete the sprint (Snack, sticky notes, Coffee, etc...)

* Establish the rules

* Planning Introduction
    As sprint involve cross-functional teams to work on a project, sprint planner might conduct participant introduction (Ex: Ask participant who have once answer a customer service call in UX design sprint introduction).

* Plan Post sprint
    Plan how the teams might use what have been learn to achieve other goals. Make sure some people in the team handle documentation, collecting sticky notes, ect...

### Design sprint brief

-- Definition
A sprint brief is a tool for aligining team and stakeholder on the goals and deliverables for the sprint. It means align participant with the goals to be meet by the sprint.

`A sprint leader` - It's usually the person who sends out the sprint brief to the team.

**Note**
A shared document ( `as Google Docs or MS Word tool online` ) provides a great place for crafting sprint challenge.

-- Identify the Sprint the Challenge
Not all product implementation requires a design sprint. Asking oneself specific question helps UX designer to identify the challenge as candidate to design sprint or not.

Ex: Build excuting new features for the cycling app in time for relaunch in a year

-- Key deliverables

Question to answer:

* What do the team create during the sprint ?

Ex: A complete prototype that includes the feature update

-- Add Approvers
List of members or participant to the sprint

-- Resources
It's recommendes that one start a sprint by having assigned development resources to carry the work after the sprint.

-- Project overview

Key phases are:

* Current State of the project (What have been created, the time output of the project)
* Roadblocks (What stand in the way of the project)
* Early wins if any
* Estimate lauch plan (Projected launch of the product, What will it look like when lauched, etc...)

## Reflect on Design Sprint

### Design Sprint Retrospectives

It's a collaborative critique of the team's design sprint. Mostly retrospective is done immediately after sprint so that everyone starts are fresh.
The goal of a retrospective is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has the chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improvement.

Questions:

* What went well
  * Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
  * When did you feel the most satisfaction?
  * What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?
* What can be improved
  * What went wrong that caught you off guard?
  * Which problems came up the most often?
  * When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?

**Note**
Retrospective note might be taken by a given user. It should be empowering, not shaming.
