## History

## The basics of UX Design

* User experience
  It's how a user (product user) feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.

* Product
  It's just a good or a service being physical(Game Controller, Potato ships, etc...) or virtual(App, Website).

* Factor of good user experience
  + Usability
    Design purpose, is clean/clear to everyone. UX designer must think about every users that might use his/her products.

  + Equitability
    Product must be usable by users with diverse ability and background

  + Enjoyable
    Creates positive connection between users and product.
    **Note** To learn more about how users feels about a product, we conduct a research that may ask users reviews about the product or collect data about product usage.

  + Useful
    Product should help user solves a problem.
    As you evaluate how useful a product’s UX is, you can ask questions like: Does the design add value to the user’s experience? Does the design solve a problem for the user? Does the design help the user achieve a specific goal?

## Job field for UX Designer

* Empathy

UX Designer are empathetic, meaning they have the ability to understand someone else's feelings or though in a situation.

There a type of UX Designers:

* Interactive designer
Focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. Figures out users need and company goal. Interaction designers focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They strive to understand the user flow, or the path, that a typical user takes to complete a task on an app, website, or other platform. At Google and many other companies, interaction designers are a specialized type of UX designer.

Who focus on designing the `experience of a product and how it functions` . They `figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build` .

* Visual designer: Focus on how product or technology looks.

They might be responsible `for designing logos, illustrations, or icons` . They may also decide `font color and size, or work on product layouts` . Motion designers are another common type of UX designer. They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a `product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website` .

* Motion designer: They think about how it feel like for a user to use a product.

Roles occupied during product design lifecycles:

* UX researchers
UX researchers conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. UX researchers often identify pain points that users are experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems. They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or website, for example.

* UX writers
UX writers think about how to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is more intuitive. UX writers also help define a brand’s voice and personality. The work of UX writers often includes writing labels for buttons and determining the tone of language used within an app or website.

**Note**
UX writers focus on answering questions like: What words should be used to communicate this idea clearly? Should the tone for this app be friendly or technical? And, what should the language on this button label say? UX writers often become subject matter experts in order to present content that’s easy to understand for all users.

* Production designers: They works as the bridge between designer and engineering teams to provides a great value product

* UX engineers
UX engineers translate the design’s intent into a functioning experience, like an app or a website. They help UX teams figure out if designs are intuitive and technically feasible.

* UX Program managers: Ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful production flow smoothly from start to finish.

* Conversation designer
Conversational interfaces are everywhere, from intelligent virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, to interactive voice response systems like customer service systems you can talk to. Conversational interfaces even include automobile navigation systems and chatbots! Conversation design incorporates natural, real-world conversational behaviors into the interactions between users and these systems.
Conversation designers make it possible for users to have natural conversations to get things done. They leverage user research, psychology, technical knowledge, and linguistics to create user experiences that are intuitive and engaging. Conversation designers develop the “persona” or personality of the voice, as well as the flow and dialog of the interaction.

* Wireframe
An outline or sketch of a product or a screen. It help the designer find out how pages are desgined... how component interacts etc...

* Prototype

### Specialists, generalists, and T-shaped designers

* Generalist

For example, you might do a bit of interaction design work, a bit of visual design work, and more. One benefit of being a generalist is that you get to try out roles and find a specialty that you're passionate about.

* Specialist

* T-Shaped
A T-shaped designer specializes in one kind of UX design and has a breadth of knowledge in other areas. This is called a T-shaped designer because your skills look like an uppercase T. The vertical line of the T is the kind of UX design you specialize in, like visual design. The horizontal line across the top of the T includes your complementary skills. These skills might come from other fields, like interaction design, that cross over with your specialties or soft skills that help you work more effectively.

### Interact with cross-functional teammates

UX design is a highly collaborative field, where designers typically work in cross-functional teams. Your future teammates might include engineers, UX researchers, program managers, product leads, fellow designers, and others.
