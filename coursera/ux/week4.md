# Week 4 - User research

It is fundamental & it takes place though the development lifecycle of a product and even after.

**Note**
UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions. UX research aligns what you, as the designer, think the user needs with what the user actually needs.

There are two key parts to every UX design project: conducting research to learn about the users you’re designing for, and gathering feedback about their perspectives. UX design is all about putting the user first, and research helps designers understand those users.

## Introduction

User research is a continuous part of the product development life cycle and takes place before, `during`, and after phase 3 : `Design`

Research that takes place before anything is designed is usually called `foundational research`. Some UX teams might also call it `strategic or generative research`.

- Fundational research

The main goal of the fundational research is to identify user problem the system or product is being designed for. It answers question like:

-- What is to be build
-- Waht are the user problems ?
-- How can the problem being solved
-- Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?

**Note**
is always done before you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens during the brainstorm stage (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make personas and user stories.

Common fundational research might include:

-- `Interviews`: A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.
-- `Surveys`: An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.
-- `Focus groups`: A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design.

- Design research

They are researches that take place during phase 3. Question during that research are:

-- How is the product if to be build to satisfy user needs/requirements
-- How is your difficult for you to use the product prototype ?
-- Do you enconter any issue using the product prototype ?

The goal of the design research is to inform how the product is to be built.

**Note**
Design research is done while you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk.

Additional research methods that might be used to conduct design research include:

- `A/B testing`: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective.

- `Cafe or guerrilla studies`: A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts.

- `Card sorting`: A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them.

- Post Launch research

It happens at the endo the product development lifecycle. It try to find wether the new added feature is meeting the needs of the users.

**Note**
It's done after the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help validate that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.

Research methods you might use to conduct post-launch research include:

- `A/B testing`
- `Usability studies`
- `Surveys`

-- Do we succeed to meet user requirements ?

### Quality of a good user research

- Empathy
  Able to understand someone else feelings or thoughs in a situation
- Prgamatism
  Focused on reaching goals. More for problems solving
- Colloboration
  Being able to work wit range of people, personalitiies and work styles.

## User Experience Reasearch methods

### Types of research

The first way to categorize research is based on who conducts the research: primary research and secondary research.

- Primary research
  It is research you conduct yourself. Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research.

- Secondary research
  It is research that uses information someone else has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.

The second way to categorize research is based on the type of data collected: `qualitative` or `quantitative`.

- Qualitative research
  It is primarily collected through `observations and conversations`. Qualitative research is based on understanding users’ needs and aims to answer questions like “`why`” or “`how did this happen?`”

- Quantitative research
  It focuses on data that can be gathered by `counting or measuring`. Quantitative research is based on numerical data that’s often collected from large-scale surveys. This type of research aims to answer questions like “`how many?`” and “`how much?`”

### Common primary research

- Interviews

They are a research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Interviews can be performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group.

**Note**
Best practice is to conduct at least five user interviews during your research. As you conduct your interviews, you’ll start to find similarities in the feedback that users provide about what works and what doesn’t work about your product. This is exactly the kind of feedback you want!

Pros:

    -- Better understand what users think and why
    -- Adjust questions and refocus the discussion based on users answers.
    -- Ability to ask follow up questions in real time
    -- Ability to ask specific questions to user needs
    -- Receive direct suggestions from the users

Cons:

    -- Time consuming & expensive as users will be invited in to conduct the interview - Sample size are smaller due to time and money constraints
    -- Group interviews can be affected by the bandwagon effect, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively.

- Survey

It is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product. Surveys are a great way to measure the success of your product, during development and after it’s launched.

**Note**
You can design surveys to include open-ended questions for qualitative research, which allow research participants to clarify their survey responses, as well as close-ended questions for quantitative research, which generate numerical data.

Pros:

    -- Learn more from larger samples
    -- Gather results and insights quickly
    -- usually inexpensive because they don't take as much time for participants to complete.

Cons:

    -- Do not often provides in-depth feedback
    -- There are some type of question that do not work in surveys
    -- Survey usually do not allow for personalization

- Usability study

It is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users. Usability studies help demonstrate if a product is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted.
There are lots of ways to test usability, both in person and online.

**Note**
It is best to record usability session either through audio or videos.

**Note**
Qualitative research is based on observations, and a critical part of conducting usability studies is observing how participants interact with the product you’ve designed.

Pros:

    -- Learn from first hand user interaction and observation
    -- Challenge designer assumptions about product by demonstrating a completely differenc result than the one you he was expecting
    -- User can provide in-depth feedbacks

Cons:

    -- It only measure how easy the product is to use
    -- Expensive because conduct in person
    -- There can be differences between a “controlled” usability study in a lab versus how a user experiences the product in their real life. 

### Secondary research methods

Secondary research can be completed at any phase of the project, since you’re using information from outside sources. In other words, secondary research is not a direct result of your product or the user you’re designing for.

**Note**
The information you discover during secondary research might lay a foundation for your primary research, so you have a better idea of where to focus your efforts.

Pros:

    -- Secondary research is generally cheaper and faster than primary research.
    -- Resources for secondary research can easily be find through online researchs
    -- Good supplements to `findings` from primary research

Cons:

    -- Not capable to learn from user interaction with the product
    -- No user feedbacks
    -- Can be misleading and generalizing if not done appropriately
