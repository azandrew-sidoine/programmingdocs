# Week 2 : Thinking like a UX designer

## User Centered design

This type of design puts the user front and center. Considering their stories, emotions and the insight you gardered about them.

This type of design framework has 4 steps:

- Understand
    Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.

- Specify
    Specify the end-user needs based on research

- Design
    Design solution to the end-user problem. This is where you start to come out with ideas that make up a solution for user's problem.

- Evaluate
    Evaluate the design against the end-user needs. At this step we execute a test centered approach to the finished product.

### Who are my users?

A user is a person who is trying to solve a problem and is looking for a product or service to help them solve it.

**Note**
The user experience is the journey that the user takes with that product or service.

**Warning**
One of the key challenges of getting to know your users is avoiding taking a narrow view of the user, or making assumptions about what users need based on stereotypes. Users who seem to be different from one another might actually have shared wants and needs. Make sure to step back and get a clear picture of all your potential users–which often means that you’ll need to specifically plan to address the needs of users who are often overlooked.

Here is a list of quest to consider when performing product research phase:
> Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider–whether temporary, situational, or permanent?
> How familiar are my users with technology?
> How are my users accessing the product or service?
> Where and when are my users accessing the product or service?
> Have I considered all my potential users?

**Note**
Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity; educational background; and geographic location.

**Key takeaway**
Your goal as a UX designer is to solve a user problem by creating a design that makes every user feel like you designed the experience just for them no matter who they are, where they live, how much they earn, what their abilities are, or how highly they're educated. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of your user's context is an important place to start, and you're already on your way.

## Assistive Technology (AT)

ATs are any products, equipement & system that enhance learning, working and daily living for people with disbilities.

- Color modification
    Color modification like high contrast mode  or dark mode, increases the contrast of elements on the screen.

**Note**
    High contrast make thing easier to see for people with low vision accurancy.

- Voice Control
    Helps people with limited dexterity and can serve as alternative to a keyboard or mouse. Allow users to navigate.

- Screen Readers
    Helps users with limited visibility.

- Alternative Text (alt text)
    Helps translate a visual user interface to a text based.

Solved Q&A:

Q: Which design approach should a UX designer consider for users with limited experience navigating websites?
A: Straightforward and simplistic design

## Design Thinking: A UX design framework

- What is a framework ?

In the world of `UX design`, a `framework` is a conceptual tool that provides guidance on the best `practices and processes` for solving  problems and building solutions that solve the problems of real users.

### Design Thinking framework

The Design Thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like `research`, `prototyping`, and `testing` to help you `understand who your user is`, what `their problems` are, and `what your design should include`.

Design thinking framework is composed of 5 #ts phases:

- Empathize
    Learn about user's problems, needs wants, and environment in which the designed product is used.
    Never value your own thoughts that results from the research.

    **Note**
    Researchs must include, surveys, interviews, observation sessions & competitor's implementations.

- Define
    Analyse `Empathize` phase research and define design goals. Clarify problem statement.

- Ideate
    Collect more ideas/design proposition from your colleagues or collaborators though brain-storming phases.
    **Note**
    Not focusing on an initial design, instead gathering more insights, makes the best outcome.

- Protoype
    After you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the prototype phase, where your goal is to produce an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality and can be used for testing

- Test
    An organized approach to testing can help you create exceptional user experiences.

    **Note**
    Prototyping and Testing are interconnected, meaning the design is tested at each stage of the prototype development.

- Implement
    Got this step from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lmvCqvmjfE] youtube video content.

**Note**
Though it's seems a linear process, design thinking should be iterative.

**Note!!**
Keep in mind that the Design Thinking framework as presented here is an idealized model for UX designers to follow, so you might see some variation in its implementation  between different companies, teams, or projects.

**Key Takeway**
The Design Thinking framework is only one type of framework that UX designers use to organize their approach to designs, often based on the product they’re designing and the organization they’re working for. No matter which frameworks you use in your career, they all have a few core principles in common:

> Focus on the user.
> Create solutions that address the user’s problems.
> Collaborate with teammates across departments.
> Validate your designs.
> Iterate as needed to design the right user experience.

## Equity focus design

In equity-focused designer think through all the aspect of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races and abilities.
Plus, designs need to specificially consider underrepresented and excluded groups.

**Note**
UX Researchers when collecting information, must ask themselves questions like, what should be included and what are not required for the questionnaire being conducted.

**Note** `Gender`
Gender Non Conforming -> Having a gender that does not conform a given society cultural
NonBinary -> Not having a Gender being Male or Female (Open a wide range of selection)

## Get to know Platforms

- Platform (Mobile device, Desktop, Wearable, Tablets, etc...)
It's the medium that users experience designers product on. Designers must design their product with the goal to make them accessible to all users no matter the platform (look and feel the same on all platforms) the product runs on.

**Note**
First the design is done toward a specific platform, and later supportr is added for other platforms.

- Brand identity
It's visual appearance and voice of a given company.

## Designing for multiple platform

### User behaviour with Mobile phone

- Responsiveness (Screen size) - Allows website to change dynamically depending on the platform size.
- Interaction - How users interact with product and accessiblity consideration is a critical part of product design (Screen reader, closed captionning, Switch device)
- Content Layout
    In the world of UX design, layouts refer to the way that information is organized on the screen
- Functionality
    There are a lot of reasons why users might choose one platform over another, but functionality and the kind of tasks they want to complete is a huge driver. Your designs for each platform will likely vary based on how and when you expect users to need the product.

-- Best practice for mobile design

- Call to action buttons must be centered on the UI
- Navigation menu should be short and simple
- Gestures should be intuitive on the product designed
- Consider vertial portrait view and Horizontal landscape view

Key considerations:

- (72s) Average mobile session -> (150s) Average desktop session
- Mobile users then to be goal oriented (meaning the only use application)
